# wwvb Arduino Clock
WWVB Arduino Project by KI0GU

A DIY clock project that uses the radio signal WWVB on 60 kHz AM from Ft. Collins, Colorado
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWVB

Started out of a need for a GMT clock in my office that I could set and forget.

Hardware used for this project:
Arduino: UNO
LCD: Arduino LCD Shield 16x2 Display with push buttons
WWVB Receiver: Universal Solder Time Signal Receiver Module based on the MAS6180C AM Receiver IC
RTC: DS1307
